# 🚀 Deploy Your RE VLab Project - Step by Step Guide

## Your Django project is ready for deployment! Here are your best options:

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended - No CLI needed)

### Steps:
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your RE-VLab repository**
5. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Django project
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Deploy your app

### Environment Variables to Set in Railway:
```
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-change-this
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-project.railway.app
```

**Your app will be live at: `https://your-project.railway.app`**

## Option 2: Render (Also Easy)

### Steps:
1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Click "New Web Service"**
4. **Connect your GitHub repo**
5. **IMPORTANT: Manual Configuration Required**

### Settings in Render (COPY THESE EXACTLY):
- **Build Command:** `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `python manage.py migrate && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && gunicorn requirements_lab.wsgi:application`

### Environment Variables:
```
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-project.onrender.com
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Make sure you paste the exact start command above, not the default `gunicorn app:app`

## Option 3: PythonAnywhere (Beginner Friendly)

### Steps:
1. **Go to [pythonanywhere.com](https://pythonanywhere.com)**
2. **Create free account**
3. **Upload your project files**
4. **Set up web app in dashboard**

## Option 4: Manual Git Deployment

If you want to push to GitHub first:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - RE VLab project ready for deployment"

# Create GitHub repo and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/RE-VLab.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then use Railway or Render to deploy from GitHub.
